#Wasteland-2-caracter-editor (Tested with Director's cut)
SaveGameCaracterEditor for Wasteland 2 (Game character editor for Wasteland 2).
Developed purely from passion, written in Delphi and completely free.
However, despite the fact that the project is free, you can always support it by buying the developer a coffee.

04/21/2020 the source code became open (suffer mortals, for it is terrible)

The editor has sufficient functionality to make changes to the characteristics of units.
You can edit all skills (weapon, general, technical) and attributes. 
The interface is intuitive, but, nevertheless, you can watch a video of editing SaveGames in order to understand the principle of operation.

Well, one more thing - this project will continue to remain absolutely free, regardless of functionality..
Therefore, if someone tries to sell it to you, they are scammers üòâ
=================================

changes in version 3 (currently implemented)
from code point:
  the internal structure has undergone significant rethinking and processing (let's just start with a ‚Äúclean slate‚Äù);
  also fixed the creation errors, which previously led to corruption of the game file;
  The game file is now overwritten only when changes are saved;

from the user's point: 
  for user convenience, the save file is now scanned immediately after selection;
  The bill interface has been redesigned (some buttons have been removed)
  when saving, a backup copy of the original file is also created (in case something goes wrong)

=================================

coming soon:
  DragNDrop support;
  resetting\applying a common value to all skills by category;
  adding a timestamp when naming the backup file;
  correction of invalid values ‚Äã‚Äã(for example, in case of file processing after ‚Äúmanual correction‚Äù)

=================================

feasibility is being studied:  
  editing all available unit parameters (experience points, name, age, etc.).
  the possibility of completely editing the inventory is being considered (if it suddenly turns out that someone needs it) - there is certainly no certainty about the need, given the amount of work
